		<h2>Infinity</h2>
		<p>	Infinity is a beautiful and dangerous thing.</p>
		<p>	It is a gateway to imagination,</p>
		<p>	And a gateway to insanity.</p>
		<p>	Infinity is uncontrollable, swiping,</p>
		<p>	It’s infinitely large hand and causing infinite destruction in its path.</p>
			<br><br>
		<p>	Infinity is mesmerizing, Wondrous, Torturous.</p>
		<p>	Infinity is far beyond humanity’s mental boundaries,</p>
		<p>	And brings a chaotic consumption of theories.</p>
			<br><br>
		<p> 	Infinity keeps us in line,</p>
		<p>	Like the infinite points of a circle,</p>
		<p>	Turning at every infinite angle.</p>
		<p>	In a cycle of exploration that is only so new.</p>
			<br><br>
		<p>	Infinity is not the number or atoms in the universe,</p>
		<p>	Or any unit smaller than that.</p>
		<p>	We all know even that has an ending,</p>
		<p>	Unless the universe expands.</p>
			<br><br>
		<p>	And if that were the case,</p>
		<p>	We would have to join hands with infinite knowledge.</p>
		<p>	But we know that’s impossible.</p>
		<p>	We are only at the edge of understanding its power.</p>
			<br><br>
		<p>	So why should we even bother with the concept of infinity?</p>
		<p>	When it seems like a mere fantasy.</p>
		<p>	But to believe, you must have hope in the impossible,</p>
		<p>	Unless infinity is possible, but just far too much to handle,</p>
		<p>	Believe in the impossible.</p>
